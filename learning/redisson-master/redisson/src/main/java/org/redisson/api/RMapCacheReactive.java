 *
 * <p>Current redis implementation doesnt have map entry eviction functionality.
 * Thus entries are checked for TTL expiration during any key/value/entry read operation.
 * If key/value/entry expired then it doesn't returns and clean task runs asynchronous.
 * Clean task deletes removes 100 expired entries at once.
 * In addition there is {@link org.redisson.eviction.EvictionScheduler}. This scheduler
 * deletes expired entries in time interval between 5 seconds to 2 hours.</p>
 *
 * <p>If eviction is not required then it's better to use {@link org.redisson.reactive.RedissonMapReactive}.</p>
